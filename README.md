PerspectiveProjection-with-OpenGL
=================================

I use Perspective Projection to display a pyramid cube and implement a function that rotates the pyramid cube by theta degrees about an arbitrary axis

If the viewpoint is closer to the image, the image displayed in the screen is bigger, and if some part of the image is out of screen, we cannot see that part. When the size of the screen is increased, the image is smaller in the screen, when the distance of the screen is increased, the image is bigger in the screen, when we have more pixel in the screen, the lines of the image is smoother.
